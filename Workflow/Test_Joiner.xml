  <Variable initializer="script:(identityDisplayName != void) ? identityDisplayName : resolveDisplayName(identityName)" input="true" name="identityDisplayName">
    <Description>
      The displayName of the identity being updated.
      Query for this using a projection query and fall back to the name.

  <Variable input="true" name="plan">
    <Description>The provisioning plan ready to execute.</Description>
  </Variable>
  <Variable input="true" name="flow">
    <Description>
      The name of the LCM flow that launched this workflow.

      This is one of these three values:

      AccountsRequest
      EntitlementsRequest
      RolesRequest
    </Description>
  </Variable>
  <Variable editable="true" initializer="false" name="optimisticProvisioning">
    <Description>
      Set to true to enable optimistic provisioning.  This will cause
      changes to the entitlements compiled from role assignments to be
      applied immediately to the identity cube rather than waiting
      for the next refresh/reaggregation after the provisioning system
      completes the request.
    </Description>
  </Variable>
  <Variable editable="true" initializer="true" name="foregroundProvisioning">
    <Description>
      Normally provisioning is done in a step that uses the "background"
      option to force the workflow to be suspend and be resumed in a
      background task thread.  This prevents the browser session from
      hanging since provision can sometimes take a long time.  For demos
      and testing it can be better to do this in the foreground so that
      provisioning will have been performed when control is returned to the
      user.  This prevents having to run the Perform Maintenance task to
      see the results of the request.
    </Description>
  </Variable>
  <Variable input="true" name="batchRequestItemId">
    <Description>
      Used by the batch interface to record back individual request item status. The specific item id for the individual request in the batch file.

  </Variable>
  <Variable editable="true" name="doRefresh">
    <Description>
      Set to true to cause an identity refresh after the changes in the plan
      have been provisioned.  This is normally off, you might want this on
      if you want modification of identity or link attributes to result in
      an immediate re-evaluation of assigned and detected roles.

  <Variable initializer="parallel" input="true" name="approvalMode">
    <Description>
        A string that specifies how we should handle the approvals.

        the exception of manager transfers will have only one approver.

        parallel
        Approvals are processed concurrently and there must be consensus,
        we wait for all approvers to approve.  The first approver that
        rejects terminates the entire approval.

        parallelPoll
        Approvals are processed concurrently but consensus is not required.
        All approvals will be processed, we don't stop if there are any
        rejections.

        serial
        Approvals are processed one at a time and there must be consensus.
        The first approver that rejects terminates the entire approval.

        serialPoll
        Approvals are processed in order but consensus is not required.
        All approvals will be processed, we don't stop if there are any
        rejections.  In effect we are "taking a poll" of the approvers.

        any
        Approvals are processed concurrently, the first approver to
        respond makes the decision for the group.
